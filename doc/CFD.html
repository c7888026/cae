For each mechanical time increment a CFD calculation is performed consisting of several CFD time increments. Therefore, the initial CFD time increment cannot exceed the initial mechanical time increment. CFD time increments are usually much smaller than the mechanical time increments. The CFD calculation is performed up to the end of the mechanical time increment (if the calculation is transient) or up to steady state conditions (if the CFD calculation is a steady state calculation).  <P> The parameter STEADY STATE indicates that the calculation should be performed until steady state conditions are reached. In that case the size of the mechanical time increment has not influence on the number of CFD time increments and the only limit is the value of the parameter INCF on the *STEP card. If this parameter is absent, the calculation is assumed to be time dependent and a time accurate transient analysis is performed until the end of the mechanical time increment.   <P> The parameter TIME RESET can be used to force the total time at the end of the present step to coincide with the total time at the end of the previous step. If there is no previous step the targeted total time is zero. If this parameter is absent the total time at the end of the present step is the total time at the end of the previous step plus the time period of the present step (2nd parameter underneath the *CFD keyword). Consequently, if the time at the end of the previous step is 10. and the present time period is 1., the total time at the end of the present step is 11. If the TIME RESET parameter is used, the total time at the beginning of the present step is 9. and at the end of the present step it will be 10. This is sometimes useful if transient coupled temperature-displacement calculations are preceded by a stationary heat transfer step to reach steady state conditions at the start of the transient coupled temperature-displacement calculations. Using the TIME RESET parameter in the stationary step (the first step in the calculation) will lead to a zero total time at the start of the subsequent instationary step.   <P> The parameter TOTAL TIME AT START can be used to set the total time at the start of the step to a specific value.  <P> The parameter COMPRESSIBLE  specifies that the fluid is compressible. Default is incompressible.  <P> For 3D fluid calculations the parameter TURBULENCE MODEL defines the turbulence model to be used. The user can choose among NONE (laminar calculations; this is default), K-EPSILON, K-OMEGA, BSL and SST [52].  <P> Finally, the parameter SHALLOW WATER only applied to CFD calculations with the finite element method. It indicates that the calculation is a shallow water calculation. This corresponds to a compressible fluid calculation in which the density is replaced by the fluid depth, cf. Section 6.9.20.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*CFD </LI> <LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values. </LI> </UL>  <P>  <UL> <LI>Initial time increment.
