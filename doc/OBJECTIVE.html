The feasible direction is basically the sensitivity of a design response function defined as objective, possibly corrected by design responses defined as constraints and/or geometric constraints. Right now, the calculation of a feasible direction can only be done for TYPE=COORDINATE design variables. The objective function can be any design response function defined in a previous *SENSITIVITY step. It is referred to by using its name given on the *DESIGN   RESPONSE line.  <P> There is one optional parameter TARGET. If TARGET=MIN (= default) the sensivity is calculated for a minization of the objective, if TARGET=MAX for a maximization. The difference comes into play when determining which constraints are active.  Exactly one *OBJECTIVE keyword is required in a *FEASIBLE DIRECTION step. This keyword has to be followed by exactly one design response name.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*OBJECTIVE. </LI> <LI>the parameter target, if needed. </LI> </UL>  <P> Second line:  <UL> <LI>name of a design response </LI> </UL>  <P> <PRE>
