It can be defined on a node-by-node basis and consists of a mean value and a standard deviation, both in length units. In a robust design analysis random field vectors are generated representing the geometric tolerances up to a specified accuracy.  <P> There is one required parameter TYPE=NORMAL and there is one optional parameter CONSTRAINED. TYPE=NORMAL specifies that the tolerances are normally distributed. Right now, this is the only distribution allowed. The CONSTRAINED parameter enforces a smooth transition between those parts in the structure for which tolerances were defined and the remaining parts.   <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*GEOMETRIC TOLERANCES </LI> <LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value </LI> </UL>  <P> Second line:  <P>  <UL> <LI>Node number or node set label. </LI> <LI>Mean value of the tolerance. </LI> <LI>Standard deviation of the tolerance. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*GEOMETRIC TOLERANCES,TYPE=NORMAL,CONSTRAINED
N1,1.5,3.7
</PRE>  <P> assigns normally distributed tolerances with a mean value of 1.5 length units and a standard deviation of 3.7 length units to all nodes in set N1. The random fields are constrained, i.e. a smooth transition of the random field vectors is requested between the nodes in set N1 and the remaining nodes in the structure.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: beamprand.  <P>  </body></html>
