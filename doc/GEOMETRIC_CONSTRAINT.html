It can only be used for design variables of type COORDINATE.  <P> Right now, the following geometric constraint types are allowed:  <P>  <UL> <LI>FIXSHRINKAGE: the structure is not allowed to shrink for the given node   set: </LI> <LI>FIXGROWTH: the structure is not allowed to grow for the given node set. </LI> <LI>MAXMEMBERSIZE: the minimum distance between each node of a given set   and the nodes of an opposite node set is not allowed to exceed a given   size in the user's units. </LI> <LI>MINMEMBERSIZE: the minimum distance between each node of a given set   and the nodes of an opposite node set is not allowed to fall below a given   size in the user's units. </LI> </UL>  <P> There are now parameters on this keyword.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINT. </LI> </UL>  <P> Second line:  <UL> <LI>the type of the geometric constraint </LI> <LI>a node set </LI> <LI>an opposite node set (only for type MAXMEMBERSIZE and MINMEMBERSIZE) </LI> <LI>an absolute value (only for type MAXMEMBERSIZE and MINMEMBERSIZE) </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*FEASIBLE DIRECTION
*GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINT
MAXMEMBERSIZE,N1,N2,.1
</PRE>  <P> specifies that the distance between each node of set N1 and the nodes in set N2 should not exceed .1 in the user's units.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: .  <P>  </body></html>
