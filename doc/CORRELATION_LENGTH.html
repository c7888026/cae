It has the unit of length and is a measure for how connected the outer geometry is. A small correlation length means that the surface finish of the structure allows for high frequency geometric deviations such as very local dents. A large correlation length allows only for low frequency deviations, i.e. any deviations are rather smooth and extend over a larger area. A small correlation length will require a larger set of random field vectors to represent the geometric tolerances to a given accuracy.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*CORRELATION LENGTH </LI> </UL>  <P> Second line:  <UL> <LI>correlation length </LI> </UL>  <P> <PRE>
